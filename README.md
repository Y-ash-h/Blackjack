# Blackjack Game

## Overview

This is a simple command-line Blackjack game written in Python. The game simulates dealing cards from a deck, calculating their values, and determining the player's hand. The focus is on understanding basic game logic, card shuffling, and sum calculation in Blackjack.

## Features

- **Deck of Cards**: The game uses a standard 52-card deck with four suits (`spades`, `diamonds`, `hearts`, `clubs`) and 13 ranks (`A`, `2`, `3`, ..., `10`, `J`, `Q`, `K`).
- **Card Dealing**: The game deals two cards to the player from the shuffled deck.
- **Card Values**: Face cards (`J`, `Q`, `K`) are valued at 10 points each, and the Ace (`A`) is valued at 11 points by default. Numeric cards retain their respective values.

## How to Play

1. **Shuffle the Deck**: The game begins by shuffling the deck.
2. **Deal Cards**: Two cards are dealt to the player.
3. **Calculate Hand Value**: The value of the two dealt cards is summed up based on Blackjack rules.
4. **Display Output**: The dealt cards and the total hand value are displayed.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Save the provided code in a file named `blackjack.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing `blackjack.py`.
4. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python blackjack.py
   ```

## Code Explanation

- **Card Deck**: A list of suits and ranks is used to generate the deck of cards, which consists of 52 elements (each card is a combination of suit and rank).
  
- **Shuffling**: The `shuffle()` function randomizes the order of the cards in the deck using Python's built-in `random.shuffle()` method.
  
- **Dealing**: The `deal()` function deals two cards by popping the last two cards from the shuffled deck.

- **Value Calculation**: The hand value is calculated in a loop:
  - Face cards (`J`, `Q`, `K`) are worth 10 points.
  - The Ace (`A`) is worth 11 points (though this could be adjusted to be 1, depending on game rules).
  - Numeric cards are converted to integers and summed.

## Game Logic

The game can be extended to a full Blackjack simulation, including:
- The dealer's hand
- Multiple rounds of card dealing
- Player choices (Hit or Stand)
- Bust logic (when the hand exceeds 21 points)
- Ace flexibility (can be counted as 1 or 11 based on the situation)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- `random` module (part of the standard Python library)

## Future Improvements

- Implement dealer logic and complete the rules of Blackjack.
- Add functionality for player decisions (Hit, Stand, Double Down, etc.).
- Support for multiple players.
- Handle Ace values more dynamically based on the hand's current sum.
